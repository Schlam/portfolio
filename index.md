## Data Modeling

One technology at the core of most every data professional's work flow
is machine learning. Data scientists who keep up with advancements in
the field provide companies a competitive advantage over competitors
who are waiting to buy a finished-product version from a third party.

The following are examples of code take straight from academic journals
and applied in real world contexts.

### [Facial Recognition using various Deep Learning techniques](/projects/facial_recognition.md)

<img src="images/facial_recognition.png?raw=true"/>

The data in question here is the classic Faces dataset from AT&T labs,
which contains 400 photos taken in the early 90s at Cambridge University.

This project intends to serve as a catelog of many common and useful
techniques in Computer Vision. Using relatively small collection of images
that can be downloaded from `sklearn.datasets` in a few lines allows for
portability, and the organized, modular nature makes it easy to scale
for larger, more complex computer vision tasks.

This is available as a template on GitHub-- for those who might benefit
from a starter notebook-- and an accompanying article on Medium is
available for those seeking educational resources in this space.

### [Predicting $BTC-USD using sentiment from Reddit forums like r/WallStreetBets](/projects/btc.md)

The many interesting applications of time series analysis are
often overshadowed by the trite efforts to predict the stock market.

Being fully aware of this, I'd like to share links to some great
notebooks showing other ways to apply these methods:

- Predicting sun spots
- Predicting the weather
- Predicting traffic patterns
- Predicting migration patterns

Now I'd like to think I've earned some leeway to discuss a trendy little
equity called Bitcoin, and it's relationship with the internet.

Bitcoin's creator is unknown to this day. The white paper introducing
the novel technology was authored under the pseudonymn Satoshi Nakamoto.

The brilliance of it's success lies in the fact that that absolutely 100%
of Bitcoin's growth is organic, and whatever value it holds is defined by
the relationship between peers in a network. Unlike the gold at Fort Knox
and US currency, there is nothing material backing its worth and no 
individual entity controls it, it is *decentralized*.

A technology like this is almost kin to social media, save the fact that
private companies are technically in control of the platform and can
ultimately become arbiters of truth when executives deem that
the situation demands it.

Because of this, it may seem natural to use trends in public discourse
to make sense of how Bitcoin's price fluctuates.

## Investigative Analytics

Sometimes the best way to make sense of data is not to use
some complicated and opaque machine learning method, but to
present certain aspects, metrics, and aggregate measures in
a clear way that speaks to the reality underlying that data.

This is where the Data Analyst provides value-- by transforming
deceptively arbitrary rows in a dataset into actionable intelligence.
