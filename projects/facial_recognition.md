**Technologies used:**

Tensorflow

Keras

Sci-Kit Learn

**Common problems with computer vision:**

- Lack of training data

- Lack of in-house computational resources

- Cloud GPU time can be expensive

- Lack of transparency with a "black box" neural network

- Difficulty reproducing results without using MLFlow or wandb


**Questions this might answer for you:**

How does a bespoke convolutional neural network perform compared to a
model built using transfer learning and fine tuning? 

Is it feasible to train a model to high accuracy on a CPU-only computer?

What callbacks are built into Keras, and how can I build my own?

How can one use image augmentation to overcome lack of training data?
